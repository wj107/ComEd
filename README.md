### ComEd

Average hourly load -- energy usage, hour-by-hour -- data from ComEd.  Available from April 2009.  Run `get_data.R` script, and it will donwload data as an xls file, convert into 5 different data frames, containing average hourly electricity usage for:

- Single family houses
- Multi family houses
- Small businesses
- Medium businesses
- Streetlights

Not sure the specific differences between those categories; documentation is scant.  If you want more info, probably best to start looking at the [Com Ed website](https://www.comed.com/MyAccount/MyService/Pages/ARCHIVE/HistoricalLoadProfiles.aspx).
